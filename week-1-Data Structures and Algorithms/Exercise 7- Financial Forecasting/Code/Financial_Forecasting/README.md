# Exercise 7 â€“ Financial Forecasting (Recursion)

Logic:-
    Uses the compound growth formula:  
    FV = PV * (1 + r)^n, implemented recursively.

Files:-
  `ForecastCalculator.java`: Recursive logic to compute future value.
  `TestForecast.java`: Runs the calculator with sample inputs.

Analysis
  Time Complexity: O(n)
  Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursion stack
